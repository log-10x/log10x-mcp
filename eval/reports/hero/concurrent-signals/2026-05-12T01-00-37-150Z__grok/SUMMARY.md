# Hero scenario: Concurrent signals — distinguish a deploy-attributable incident from unrelated noise firing at the same time

**Scenario:** `concurrent-signals`
**Status:** PARTIAL
**Env:** demo
**Runner model:** `grok-4-latest` (xai)
**Started:** 2026-05-12T01:00:37.164Z
**Duration:** 203.7s
**Bash calls:** 5

## User question

> Two distinct ERROR-shaped patterns are firing in the otel-demo namespace right now. One appears to be related to checkout retry behavior; the other appears to be a DNS resolution failure on some upstream service. The customer-visible cart-abandonment alert is being driven by one of them — the team wants to know which one. Investigation rule: a planted/attributable incident has a deploy trail (the emitting workload has a canary.github.io/sha annotation pointing at a real commit in talwgx/test); concurrent natural noise typically does NOT have a deploy trail. For each of the two ERROR patterns, find the emitting workload via kubectl, check whether it has a canary.github.io/sha annotation, and (if it does) resolve that SHA via gh api. Report: which pattern has a deploy trail and is therefore the cart-abandonment cause, and which is unrelated concurrent noise. You have kubectl + gh CLI.

## Three axes

- **Hallucination (drift score):** 0 unsupported · 0 supported · 0 inconclusive
- **Value delivered:** 0.00 — The sub-agent never identified the two distinct ERROR patterns (checkout retry vs DNS resolution failure), never ran kubectl to find emitting workloads, never checked for canary.github.io/sha annotations, and never resolved any SHA via gh api — the actual investigation was never performed and no actionable answer was produced.
- **Value received:** 0.20 — The MCP tools returned some top-patterns data but none of it was specific enough to surface the two named ERROR patterns or their emitting workloads, and the namespace/label scoping did not yield the targeted incident data needed for the investigation.
- **Cost (runner only):** $0.0614 — 18981 in / 297 out tokens across 5 API calls
- **Flags:** low_value_delivered, low_value_received
